abstract="To gain competitive advantage, hospitals try to streamline their processes. In order to do so, it is essential to have an accurate view of the ``careflows'' under consideration. In this paper, we apply process mining techniques to obtain meaningful knowledge about these flows, e.g., to discover typical paths followed by particular groups of patients. This is a non-trivial task given the dynamic nature of healthcare processes. The paper demonstrates the applicability of process mining using a real case of a gynecological oncology process in a Dutch hospital. Using a variety of process mining techniques, we analyzed the healthcare process from three different perspectives: (1) the control flow perspective, (2) the organizational perspective and (3) the performance perspective. In order to do so we extracted relevant event logs from the hospital's information system and analyzed these logs using the ProM framework. The results show that process mining can be used to provide new insights that facilitate the improvement of existing careflows.",

At the same time, there are many other metrics that compare a model with recorded behavior in terms of the precision of the model and the extent to which the model generalizes the behavior in the log. Furthermore, several metrics exist to measure the complexity of a model irrespective of the log.",

Many information systems provide such logs, e.g., most WFM, ERP, CRM, SCM, and B2B systems record transactions in a systematic way. Process mining techniques typically focus on performance and control-flow issues. However, event logs typically also log the performer, e.g., the person initiating or completing some activity. This paper focuses on mining social networks using this information. For example, it is possible to build a social network based on the hand-over of work from one performer to the next. By combining concepts from workflow management and social network analysis, it is possible to discover and analyze social networks. This paper defines metrics, presents a tool, and applies these to a real event log within the setting of a large Dutch organization.",

abstract="Traditionally, process mining has been used to extract models from event logs and to check or extend existing models. This has shown to be useful for improving processes and their IT support. Process mining techniques analyze historic information hidden in event logs to provide surprising insights for managers, system developers, auditors, and end users. However, thus far, process mining is mainly used in an offline fashion and not for operational decision support. While existing process mining techniques focus on the process as a whole, this paper focuses on individual process instances (cases) that have not yet completed. For these running cases, process mining can used to check conformance, predict the future, and recommend appropriate actions. This paper presents a framework for operational support using process mining and details a coherent set of approaches that focuses on time information. Time-based operational support can be used to detect deadline violations, predict the remaining processing time, and recommend activities that minimize flow times. All of this has been implemented in ProM and initial experiences using this toolset are reported in this paper.",

    abstract = { In the healthcare domain, a wide range of processes with different characteristics and requirements are executed, ranging from highly standardised procedures to less structured ones that reflect the knowledge-intensive nature of clinical decision making. Healthcare is thus widely recognised as one of the most promising, yet challenging, domains for the adoption of process-oriented models and solutions able to support organisational and clinical processes. In this paper, we provide an up-to-date overview that presents and discusses the application of process-oriented solutions in the healthcare domain. Our analysis covers both administrative/organisational processes and medical processes, and we consider contributions and research efforts produced by the business process management (BPM) community and the medical informatics community. We delineate the overall evolution that has been observed from imperative and activity-centric approaches to the emergence of declarative data-centric methodologies, including the recent trends towards adaptive case management in healthcare. }

abstract="Understanding the performance of business processes is an important part of any business process intelligence project. From historical information recorded in event logs, performance can be measured and visualized on a discovered process model. Thereby the accuracy of the measured performance, e.g., waiting time, greatly depends on (1) the availability of start and completion events for activities in the event log, i.e. transactional information, and (2) the ability to differentiate between subtle control flow aspects, e.g. concurrent and interleaved execution. Current process discovery algorithms either do not use activity life cycle information in a systematic way or cannot distinguish subtle control-flow aspects, leading to less accurate performance measurements. In this paper, we investigate the automatic discovery of process models from event logs, such that performance can be measured more accurately. We discuss ways of systematically treating life cycle information in process discovery and their implications. We introduce a process discovery technique that is able to handle life cycle data and that distinguishes concurrency and interleaving. Finally, we show that it can discover models and reliable performance information from event logs only.",

abstract="In process mining, one of the main challenges is to discover a process model, while balancing several quality criteria. This often requires repeatedly setting parameters, discovering a map and evaluating it, which we refer to as process exploration. Commercial process mining tools like Disco, Perceptive and Celonis are easy to use and have many features, such as log animation, immediate parameter feedback and extensive filtering options, but the resulting maps usually have no executable semantics and due to this, deviations cannot be analysed accurately. Most more academically oriented approaches (e.g., the numerous process discovery approaches supported by ProM) use maps having executable semantics (models), but are often slow, make unrealistic assumptions about the underlying process, or do not provide features like animation and seamless zooming. In this paper, we identify four aspects that are crucial for process exploration: zoomability, evaluation, semantics, and speed. We compare existing commercial tools and academic workflows using these aspects, and introduce a new tool, that aims to combine the best of both worlds. A feature comparison and a case study show that our tool bridges the gap between commercial and academic tools.",

abstract="As information systems are becoming more and more intertwined with the operational processes they support, multitudes of events are recorded by today's information systems. The goal of process mining is to use such event data to extract process related information, e.g., to automatically discover a process model by observing events recorded by some system or to check the conformance of a given model by comparing it with reality. In this article, we focus on process discovery, i.e., extracting a process model from an event log. We focus on Petri nets as a representation language, because of the concurrent and unstructured nature of real-life processes. The goal is to introduce several approaches to discover Petri nets from event data (notably the $\alpha$-algorithm, state-based regions, and language-based regions). Moreover, important requirements for process discovery are discussed. For example, process mining is only meaningful if one can deal with incompleteness (only a fraction of all possible behavior is observed) and noise (one would like to abstract from infrequent random behavior). These requirements reveal significant challenges for future research in this domain.",

abstract="Increasingly information systems log historic information in a systematic way. Workflow management systems, but also ERP, CRM, SCM, and B2B systems often provide a so-called ``event log'', i.e., a log recording the execution of activities. Unfortunately, the information in these event logs is rarely used to analyze the underlying processes. Process mining aims at improving this by providing techniques and tools for discovering process, control, data, organizational, and social structures from event logs. This paper focuses on the mining social networks. This is possible because event logs typically record information about the users executing the activities recorded in the log. To do this we combine concepts from workflow management and social network analysis. This paper introduces the approach, defines metrics, and presents a tool to mine social networks from event logs.",

While there is consensus on the existence of solid metrics for fitness and simplicity, current metrics for precision and generalization have important flaws, which hamper their applicability in a general setting. In this paper, a novel approach to measure precision and generalization is presented, which relies on the notion of anti-alignments. An anti-alignment describes highly deviating model traces with respect to observed behavior. We propose metrics for precision and generalization that resemble the leave-one-out cross-validation techniques, where individual traces of the log are removed and the computed anti-alignment assess the model's capability to describe precisely or generalize the observed behavior. The metrics have been implemented in ProM and tested on several examples.",

These events logs need to be extracted from operational systems and can subsequently be used to discover or check the conformance of processes. ProM is a widely used tool for process mining. In earlier versions of ProM, MXML was used as an input format. In future releases of ProM, a new logging format will be used: the eXtensible Event Stream (XES) format. This format has several advantages over MXML. The paper presents two tools that use this format - XESame and ProM 6 - and highlights the main innovations and the role of XES. XESame enables domain experts to specify how the event log should be extracted from existing systems and converted to XES. ProM 6 is a completely new process mining framework based on XES and enabling innovative process mining functionality.",
